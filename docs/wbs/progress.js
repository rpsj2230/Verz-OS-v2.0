// Where each task stands when it is not done, and the commit each wave closed at. Edited by
// hand, and the only hand-edited status anywhere in the build.
//
// The owner asked on 2026-09-17 for every task on /build/tracker and /build to show one of
// OPEN, IN PROGRESS, READY FOR TESTING, BLOCKED (with the reason) or DONE. DONE is not in this
// file and cannot be put in it: it is computed from commits carrying `Closes:` and a proof
// trailer (`brain.status`), and a leaf a commit closed is shown as DONE whatever this file
// says. The other four are a person's statement about work in flight, which no commit can
// make, so they are typed here, dated, and nowhere else.
//
// A leaf with no entry is OPEN. Writing OPEN explicitly is allowed, for taking a leaf back
// out of IN PROGRESS with a date on it.
//
// `export.js` and `render.js` both call `check` and throw rather than generate, so an unknown
// id, an unknown status, DONE, a BLOCKED entry with no reason or an undated entry is a red
// build, and `brain.status.progress_of` refuses the same things in the exported `wbs.json`.
//
// Rejected: a text fingerprint per entry as `acts.js` carries. A flag there is permanent and
// outlives many edits above it; an entry here is short-lived and dated, and asking whoever
// moves a task to IN PROGRESS to paste its sentence is friction on the one file meant to be
// quick to edit. Ids are appended and never inserted (CLAUDE.md), which is the guard.
//
// Fields per entry:
//   status   one of STATUSES
//   why      what is happening, or for BLOCKED what it waits on; required for BLOCKED
//   updated  the day the entry was last true, YYYY-MM-DD
//
// WAVE_RECORDS is the other half, M38.2.1.1: the deployed commit at the end of each wave,
// recorded by whoever accepted the wave on staging. Release tags are cut only for client
// installs, so this record, and not a tag, is what says which commit a wave ended at.
